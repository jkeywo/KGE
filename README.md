Libraries
=========
You need your own local folders in the KGE directory (the same one as the VS solution files) called Include and Lib.

Include should have the following folders, each containing the relevant header files:

* Boost
* Box2D
* Lua
* RapidXML
* SFML

Lib should have the following files:

* Box2d.lib
* Box2d-d.lib
* Box2d-d.pdb
* lua5.1.lib
* sfml-audio-s.lib
* sfml-audio-s-d.lib
* sfml-graphics-s.lib
* sfml-graphics-s-d.lib
* sfml-system-s.lib
* sfml-system-s-d.lib
* sfml-window-s.lib
* sfml-window-s-d.lib

All compiled for VS2010 (all projects currently use this as their compiler version).
